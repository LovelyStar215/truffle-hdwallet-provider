# truffle-hdwallet-provider
HD Wallet-enabled Web3 provider. Use it to sign transactions for addresses derived from a 12-word mnemonic.

## Install

```
$ npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
```

## Requirements
```
Node >= 7.6
```

## General Usage

You can use this provider wherever a Web3 provider is needed, not just in Truffle. For Truffle-specific usage, see next section.

```javascript
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
var mnemonic = "opinion destroy betray ..."; // 12 word mnemonic
var provider = new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "http://localhost:8545");

// Or, alternatively pass in a zero-based address index.
var provider = new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "http://localhost:8545", 5);

//Or, use your own hierarchical derivation path
var provider = new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "http://localhost:8545", 5, 1, "m/44'/137'/0'/0/");
```

By default, the `HDWalletProvider` will use the address of the first address that's generated from the mnemonic. If you pass in a specific index, it'll use that address instead. Currently, the `HDWalletProvider` manages only one address at a time, but it can be easily upgraded to manage (i.e., "unlock") multiple addresses.

Parameters:

- `mnemonic`: `string`. 12 word mnemonic which addresses are created from.
- `provider_uri`: `string`. URI of Ethereum client to send all other non-transaction-related Web3 requests.
- `address_index`: `number`, optional. If specified, will tell the provider to manage the address at the index specified. Defaults to the first address (index `0`).
- `wallet_hdpath`: `string`, optional. If specified, will tell the wallet engine what derivation path should use to derive addresses. Default is `"m/44'/60'/0'/0/"`.

## Truffle Usage

You can easily use this within a Truffle configuration. For instance:

truffle.js
```javascript
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");

var mnemonic = "opinion destroy betray ...";

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
    ropsten: {
      // must be a thunk, otherwise truffle commands may hang in CI
      provider: () =>
        new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://ropsten.infura.io/"),
      network_id: '3',
    }
  }
};
```
